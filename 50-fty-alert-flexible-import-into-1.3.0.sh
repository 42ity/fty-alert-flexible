#  \brief   Convert fty-alert-flexible configs from format used in release
#           IPM_Infra-1.2.0 into the next (current) version 1.3.0

#
# Note: If format changes again, follow up by a similar scriptlet named
# with the corresponding release version, so it is alphabetically later.
# Remember that ipc-meta-setup scriptlets generally run once in a lifetime.
